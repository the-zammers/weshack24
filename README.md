<b><h1>Chinese Alchemy</b></h1>

A prototype of a game to help beginner Chinese language learners understand radicals and the way Chinese characters are written to further deepen their understanding for the Chinese language
(and hopefully help them learn and remember radicals). 

The goal is to use the radicals provided in the sidebar to create a desired Chinese character, with the meaning and pinyin given. The meaning and the pinyin of the radicals/character 
components in the sidebar will be given too. Currently there are only 16 levels, but the idea is that the more you advanced the harder the levels become, and that the words will be 
divided into stages where each stage explains a different aspect of Chinese reading. Had we had more time and a better understanding of the Chinese language, we will make a game akin to 
Little Alchemy, combining different character components to create different Chinese words.
