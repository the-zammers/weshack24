# Chinese Alchemy

A submission to WesHack 2024 by Z Cater, F Dong, and Y Yu

## Concept

A prototype of a game to help beginner Chinese language learners understand radicals and the way Chinese characters are written to further deepen their understanding for the Chinese language (and hopefully help them learn and remember radicals). 

The goal is to use the radicals provided in the sidebar to create a desired Chinese character, with the meaning and pinyin given. The meaning and the pinyin of the radicals/character components in the sidebar will be given too. Currently there are 15+ levels, but the idea is that the more you advanced the harder the levels become, and that the words will be divided into stages where each stage explains a different aspect of Chinese reading. Had we had more time and a better understanding of the Chinese language, we would've make a game akin to Little Alchemy, combining different character components to create different Chinese words. 

## Compilation

This project was built with [Processing 4](https://processing.org/), and requires the Processing framework to be run. Ensure that the *entire* `Game` folder is imported into Processing to run the game. Though Processing allows projects to be exported as executable files, this project is no longer under maintenance and will not include any releases or future updates.
